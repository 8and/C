### What is an IDE?
IDE stands for Integrated development environment. It is nothing more than an enhanced version of a text editor that helps you write more efficient and nicer code. It helps to differentiate different parts of your codes with different colors and notifying you if you are missing some semicolon or bracket at some place by highlighting that area. A lot of IDEs are available such as DEVC++ or Code Blocks but I am going to use VS Code.

### Compiler:
A compiler is used to run the program of a certain language by converting the code into the language that our computer could understand. Without a compiler we can not run our code. Every programming language is required a different compiler for its functioning because the syntax of every language is different from the other. There are a lot of compilers available, but we are going to use MinGW because it will fulfill all of our requirements and also it is recommended by Microsoft itself.

- [Download MinGW](https://github.com/8and/C/blob/main/mingw-get-setup.exe)  

- [Installation Setup](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/common/handouts/mingweclipse/mingw.html)

Would like to mention few things here: 
1. Installation of the compiler will take some time. Give installer some time and it will download and install the compiler
2. Rebooting the machine is not must after installing compiler but you can reboot only if you face any issue. Otherwise continuing without the reboot is also fine.
3. If you get gcc is not recognized error, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLh84CmdBJ0
