While loop is also called as a pre-tested loop.
A while loop allows code to be executed multiple times, depending upon a given Boolean(true or false) condition.
The while loop is mostly used in the case where the number of iterations is not known.

>If the number of iterations is known, then we use for loop.

## Syntax of while loop
```
while (condition test) {
    // Set of statements
}
```
- The body of while loop can contain a single statement or a block of statements. The condition may be any expression, and true is any nonzero value. The loop iterates while the test condition evaluates to true.

- When the condition becomes false, the program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.

## Properties of while loop
Following are some properties of while loop.

- A conditional expression written in the brackets of while is used to check the condition. The Set of statements defined inside the while loop will execute until the given condition returns false.
- The condition will return 1 if it is true. The condition will be false if it returns any other number.
- In the while loop, we cannot execute the loop until we do not specify the condition expression.
- It is possible to execute a while loop without any statements. This will give no error. 
- We can have multiple conditional expressions in a while loop.
- Braces are optional if the loop body contains only one statement.
