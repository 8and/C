# [Notes 15](https://codewithharry.com/videos/c-language-tutorials-in-hindi-15)

"For" Loop is used to repeat a specific code until a specific condition is satisfied. The for-loop statement is very specialized. We use for a loop when we know the number of iterations we want, whereas when we do not know about the number of iterations, we use while loop.


Syntax of the for loop in C programming.
```
for (initialize counter; test counter; increment/decrement counter) {
    //set of statements
 }
 ```
- Initialize counter

 It will initialize the loop counter value, i.e., i=0.
test counter: It verifies whether the condition is true.
- Increment/decrement counter

 Incrementing or decrementing the counter.
- Set of statements

Execute the set of statements.

# 
Just as if statement, we can have for loop inside another for a loop. This is known as nested for loop. Similarly, while loop and do while loop can also be nested.
```
for ( initialization; test condition; increment ) {
   for ( initialization; test condition; increment ) {
    // set of statements
   }   
   // set of statements
}
```
>Note: there is no rule that a loop must be nested inside its own type. For loop can be nested inside the while loop and vice versa. 

### Why prefer For Loops

It is clear to a developer exactly how many times the loop will execute. So, if the developer has to dry run the code, it will become easier. Also, the Syntax of the for loop is almost the same as other programming languages like C++ and Java.
