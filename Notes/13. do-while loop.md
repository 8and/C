# [Notes 13](https://codewithharry.com/videos/c-language-tutorials-in-hindi-13)

A do-while loop executes the statements inside the body of the do-while loop before checking the condition. So if a condition is false in the first place, then they do while would run once. A do-while loop is similar to a while loop, except the fact that it is guaranteed to execute at least one time.

>Unlike for and while loops, which test the loop condition first, then execute the code written inside the body of the loop, the do-while loop checks its condition at the end of the loop.
# 
```
do {
   statements;
} while(test condition);
```

If the test condition returns true, the flow of control jumps back up to do, and the set of statements in the loop executes again. This process repeats until the given test condition becomes false.


## DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHILE AND DO-WHILE
While loop is executed when given test condition return true, whereas, do-while loop is executed for the first time irrespective the test condition is true or false, because the test condition is checked after executing while loop for the first time.
